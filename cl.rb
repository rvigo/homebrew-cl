  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      In order to get cl completion (only available for ZSH shell),
      be sure that $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions is present in $FPATH.
      If not, add the following line to your ~/.zshrc, BEFORE any call to compinit:
      FPATH="$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions:${FPATH}"
    EOS
  end
